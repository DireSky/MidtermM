1 What is the difference between switch and checkout?
2 What does git merge do?
3 What happens to the commit history after rebase and why?
4 How to understand which branch is remote and which is local in the terminal?

switch vs checkout: git switch is for switching branches; git checkout is more versatile (switching, restoring files, creating branches).

git merge: Integrates changes from one branch into another

After rebase: Commit history is rewritten, leading to a linear history.

Identifying branches: Use git branch -a to list local and remote branches.
